# Welcome to Capire Samples

Find here a curated collection of samples for the [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model](https://cap.cloud.sap). 
You can clone and run them individually, or as part of the _capire/samples_ monorepo, that is, both of the below work:

```sh
git clone http://github.com/capire/bookstore  # individual
git clone http://github.com/capire/bookshop   # individual
```
```sh
git clone --recursive http://github.com/capire/samples  # all in one
```
